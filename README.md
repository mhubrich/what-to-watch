**What To Watch** is a cloud-based movie watchlist. It adds rich media and movie-related attributes so you know what to watch next.

This project contains both, back-end and front-end implementation. The back-end consists of an API to search, create, read, update and delete movies (see section [Architecture](#architecture)). All movie data and user accounts are stored remotely in a database. The front-end is implemented using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Features

* Movie attributes like synopsis, ratings or poster and direct links to IMDb and YouTube
* List of available streaming providers and offers
* Light and dark theme dependent on system preference
* User accounts and data are stored securely in a remote database
* HTTP security best practice, like CORS headers, secure cookies or the use of credentials
* User authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0
* Performance optimizations, like "lazy loading" of content or requesting images based on screen size (reduces memory footprint by 25x)
